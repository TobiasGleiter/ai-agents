				Response: Reflection is a fundamental concept in artificial intelligence (AI) that refers to the process of an AI system learning from its own experiences, successes, and failures. It's the ability to introspectively examine its own thought processes, making adjustments and improving its performance over time. Reflection enables AI systems to adapt to changing environments, learn from mistakes, and develop a deeper understanding of complex problems.
				Critque: To further improve this response, I could provide specific examples or applications of reflection in AI, such as machine learning models using meta-learning to fine-tune their performance on new tasks.
